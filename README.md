# the_most_annoying_ruby_script_ever
Why does this exist?
- I wanted to try out the Dad Jokes gem with espeak for kicks and didn't want to forget how to use it (even though implementation is extremely simple).
- Because I didn't want to use up all allowed private repositiories on my end.

## What does this script do?
The most annoying infinite loop you could possibly have on your console.
